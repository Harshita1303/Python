# Python Lists
- Lists are ordered collection of data items.
 - They store multiple items in a single variable.
 - List items are separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets [].
 - Lists are changeable meaning we can alter them after creation.

Example 1:
```python
lst1 = [1,2,2,3,5,4,6]
lst2 = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"]
print(lst1)
print(lst2)
```
Output:
```
[1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6]
['Red', 'Green', 'Blue']
```

Example 2:
```python
details = ["Abhijeet", 18, "FYBScIT", 9.8]
print(details)
```
Output:
```
['Abhijeet', 18, 'FYBScIT', 9.8]
```
As we can see, a single list can contain items of different data types.
